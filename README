Kevin's (Baribeau) popular Jasmine workshop:

It uses the "Closest To Zero" problem, which is....

  1. Given a list of Integers (they can be positive or negative), find the one
     that is closest to zero.

  2. In the case where there are two integers that are equidistant to zero (for
     example, 1 and -1), prefer the positive result.

  3. If the input is empty do nothing.

-------------
This is my initial version and will try to clean-up and check for missing cases.Feel free to send me a message if you see any issues in it.

Thanks
